    "| 8a - 8:30a | Preprocess | Load data, clean data, encode if necessary | Have a clean dataset | Load data properly with Pandas; use `df.info()`, `df.describe()`, `sum(df.isna().any())`, etc  to understand data and find what needs to be cleaned; remove nulls, replace 'dirty' data, change `dtypes`; use `pd.get_dummies()` to encode target values to 0/1 if necessary |\n",
    "| 8:30a - 9:30a | Visualize | Plot features in data to derive basic insights of features | Find important/effective features to use in model as well as features to possibly exclude | Use different plots in seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, etc to derive insights from different features.  `seaborn.pairplot()` might be a good place to start |\n",
    "| 9:30a - 11:30a | Split data and search for best model | Define X (variables) and y (target), split into Train/Test or Train/Dev/Test set, choose model(s) to use, set up parameters, run parameters and train set through GridSearchCV | Have a strong model to build defined by our limited search | RandomForestClassifier, KNN, etc and GridSearchCV |\n",
    "| 11:30a - 1:30p | Build and score model | Use parameters defined by highest scoring model found in GridSearchCV to build model | Successfully send data into model and get a score in some form | Build classification object with parameters, fit on train data, plot confusion matrix and get classification scores |\n",
    "| 1:30p - 4p | Train other models | There might have been other models not used.  Spend some more time training other models that work (see score in GridSearchCV or choose another model) | See if another model works better | Repeat building and scoring with different models, teasing hyperparameters to see if we can get a better result |"
