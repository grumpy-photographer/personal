### Week 1, Checkpoint 2 - Pandas
Download the attached file ["impeach.csv"](impeach.csv), and use it to answer the following questions.
For each question, type the answer and the Python code you used to determine the answer. 

1. What state did Daniel Patrick Moynahan represent?
2. What was the standard deviation of the conservatism score for senators in 1998? (Hint: use the "std" command to get the standard deviation.) 
3.  Which of Tennessee's two senators was ranked as more conservative in 1998: Thompson or Graham?
4.  What percentage of the vote did Bill Clinton receive in New York in the 1996 election? 
5. Bonus: Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison is not coded as "hutchison". Using any method, find the row that corresponds to Kay Bailey Hutchinson. Describe the method you used.

### Week 1, Activity 1
Create a post where you ask two questions about how to do something in pandas.

### Week 1, Activity 2 - Accesing More Tutorials
There are many great tutorials on pandas for new users that go beyond what we have covered in the introductory videos. 

Choose one of the tutorials listed [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/tutorials.html) 

Complete the tutorial, by reading/watching the video, taking notes, etc. You do not need to complete the entire tutorial, but you should spend at least 20 minutes gathering information in your preferred method. 

In the space below, list three things that you learned from this tutorial.

List one way in which it differed from Dr. Penland's tutorial. (You do not have comment on better or worse, though it will not hurt my feelings if you do.)
