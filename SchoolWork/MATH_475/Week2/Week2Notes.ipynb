    "## Overview of Machine Learning\n",
    "Questions ML can possibly answer:\n",
    "- Will this user buy the upgrade pack for our game?\n",
    "- How many emergency room patients will arrive overnight tonight?\n",
    "- Is this purchase being made with a stolen credit card?\n",
    "- Will this college basketball player play at least one regular season game in the NBA?\n",
    "- Should this person be recommended for a cancer diagnostic?\n",
    "\n",
    "** No such thing as a free lunch **\n",
    "- for a certain type of mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution, averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution method.  No solution therefore offers a \"short cut\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning\n",
    "\"The field of study that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.\"\n",
    "- commonly attributed to Arthur Samuel, 1959?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program.\"\n",

    "## Types of problems we will encounter\n",
    "Two types of variables\n",
    "- Features\n",
    "  - predictors, inputs, independent variables\n",
    "- Target\n",
    "  - response, output, depended variables\n",
    "- Observation\n",
    "  - a single element of a data set\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression\n",
    "A *regression* problem is one where we predict a *continuous numerical target variable*, based on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "A *classification* problem is one where we predict which *class* an observation will belong to, based on its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * * \n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical situation where you will deal with regression...\n",
    "- most of the work comes before you do the code to build the model\n",
    "  - look at your data\n",
    "  - which features are important?\n",
    "    - what types of relationships do the features appear to have with the target?\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "- One feature  \n",
    "- One target\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = w*x + b\n",

    "Notice what this definition contains:\n",
    "- g: the function name\n",
    "- x: the input to the function\n",
    "- an algorithm for computing the output:\n",
    "  1. square x\n",
    "  2. multiply the result from step 1 by 3\n",
    "  3. subtract 1 from the result in step 2\n",
